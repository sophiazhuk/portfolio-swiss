llm description:
this is an ai-powered clip curator. we used openai's api and vector search methods in order to parse through a large database of civil rights interviews by the library of congress. the interviews were extracted into clips by extracting the transcript, using an ai powered script to divide the 1hr+ longs interviews into clips of stories. extracting and appending keywords to the clips, then placing them into a collection of clips.
the next step, where i come in, is to develop gpt 4o to search through the catalog of clips using ai power when a user types in natural language. the combination of words then result in a handful of relevant clips curated together into a playlist.
with this playlist, you can then create lesson plans. the idea was for school teachers to use this tool to teach students about civil right movement straight from the source. 
we also used the api to extract glossary terms. this feature is useful because when you search a term, all results that contain reference to that term will show up. 
the goal of this project was to use ai power to create intuitive user interfaces to large databases where the infrastructure makes it difficult to navigate through due to lack of data.
