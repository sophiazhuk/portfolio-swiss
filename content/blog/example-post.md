## Getting Started

1. Create a markdown file in the `/content/blog/` directory
2. Add the post metadata to `/src/data/blogPosts.js`
3. The post will automatically appear on the blog home page

## Formatting

You can use all standard markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `Inline code`

### Code Blocks

const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
\`\`\`

### Lists

2. Second item
3. Third item

### Quotes
